Association in OOP means that objects of two or more classes can have some connection between each other.

Aggregation and composition are special cases of Association. This is a more fleshed out relationship between objects.

**Aggregation** is a relation when one object is part of another. For example, a Student is part of a group of physics lovers.  
**Composition** is an even more "rigid" relation when an object is not only a part of another object, but also cannot belong to anyone else.
